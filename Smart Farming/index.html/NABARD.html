    <h1>NABARD Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF)</h1>
    <div class="section"><span class="label">Description:</span> The RIDF was established by NABARD in 1995-96 to support state governments in building rural infrastructure such as irrigation, roads, bridges, health centers, and schools. It aims to fill critical gaps in rural infrastructure that are crucial for agricultural and rural development.</div>
    
    <div class="section"><span class="label">Benefits:</span> The fund provides low-interest loans to state governments and state-owned corporations for rural development projects, indirectly benefiting farmers by improving infrastructure and connectivity in rural areas.</div>
    
    <div class="section"><span class="label">Eligibility:</span> Primarily for State Governments and related institutions. However, farmers and rural communities benefit through improved access to irrigation, markets, healthcare, and education.</div>
    
    <div class="section"><span class="label">How to Apply:</span> State governments submit project proposals to NABARD. Beneficiaries (farmers or communities) can track related developments through local Panchayats or Agricultural Departments. For more details, visit:
